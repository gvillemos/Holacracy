# Holacracy

The management cocnepts of the future, at least for companies demanding creativity, is decentralized self-organizing organizations (DSOO); organizations in which the focus is on decentralized decision making, minimal centralited power structures and a focus on ensuring that people take ownership (in a team) of their own faith. A Teal organization.

Methods such as Holacracy is one way of structuring a DSOO. Holacracy defines clear processes and clear rules for howto operate a DSOO. As such it is more than concept, it is (in its own words) the DNA of an organization.
